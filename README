Quick test project to get pinch/zoom working on iOS and the native equivalent for Android. 
Basically a full screen webview inside of a Ti.UI.Window with portrait/landscape orientationModes does the trick.

The sample project will open the gallery picker, save the image to a temp folder and then pass the full filepath into the webview.
